# Conversation with ChatGPT: Windows Reinstall Prep

## User
Hey! I’m planning to wipe my PC and do a fresh Windows 11 install for audio production. Any checklist I should follow?

## Assistant
Absolutely! Here’s a basic checklist:
- Backup your data (documents, music, plugins)
- Export your DAW and plugin settings
- Download all necessary drivers (audio interface, GPU, motherboard)
- Have your Windows and software keys handy
- Make a recovery USB drive

Anything else you want to focus on?

## User
Yeah—how do I make sure I don’t lose my custom registry tweaks?

## Assistant
- Export your registry tweaks to `.reg` files before reinstalling.
- Keep a backup of `C:\Users\YourName\AppData` if you have app-specific tweaks.
- After reinstall, apply the `.reg` files and check settings.
